        <h5>Why Javascript?</h5>
        <p>
          JavaScript is the digital equivalent of the English language in the
          sense that it's universally recognized. It's also weaved into the
          fabric of programming. You see it everywhere; you're just not aware of
          it. JavaScript is present in every platform imaginable â€” browsers,
          mobile and desktop applications, IoT devices, and more!
